# USE THIS FILE TO RUN TESTS WITHOUT THE FLASK WRAPPER:
# CHANGE THE VARIABLES IN settings.py then import the class you want to test
# e.g.
# from utils.predict_doc2vec import Predict_doc2vec
# Predict_doc2vec()

# OR:
# from utils.train_votingclassifier import Train_Votingclassifier
# Train_Votingclassifier()

# ALSO MAKE SURE TO LOOK INTO THE CLASSES THEMSELVES FOR MORE SETTINGS
# (such as use_saved which reloads the Dataframe from a .pkl file)
